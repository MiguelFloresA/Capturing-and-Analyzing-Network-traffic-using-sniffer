# Capturing-and-Analyzing-Network-traffic-using-sniffer

## Objective

In this lab, I captured and analyzed traffic using a sniffer. The sniffer used in this lab was Wireshark. A sniffer is a passive scanner that just listens and records traffic on a network.  On a network with a hub, all traffic is sent to all machines. In order to see all of the traffic sent to all machines, a SPAN port will need to be configured.
